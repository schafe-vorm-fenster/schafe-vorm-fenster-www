## Notes

Left outside the slot form by DEC-0093, and it is not a grammar failure. The body is a three-column tuple — route, focus job, primary conversion — and `@leafcutter-strict/method-statement-grammar` defines seven forms, all of them sentences: goal, need, functional, quality, constraint, business rule, fit criterion. **None of them has a slot for a tuple.** The method's own instruction for this case is "a candidate that fits no form is returned for classification rather than forced into the nearest one", and the classification is right: this is a functional requirement. What is missing is upstream, a mapping form, and flattening the tuple into three sentences per page would produce 27 artefacts that say together exactly what one row says. `form: F0` records the mismatch rather than hiding it.
